							This is an agreement between Deftbase Inc., a Nigerian corporation (“Workchop"), the owner and operator of www.workchop.com 
							(the “Workchop Site”), the Workchop software, including Workchop Messenger and Vendors list (collectively, 
							including all content provided by Workchop through Workchop Messenger and the Workchop Site, the "Workchop Service", or the 
							"Service"), and you (“you” or “You”), a user of the Service. BY USING THE SERVICE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF 
							SERVICE, AND WORKCHOP'S PRIVACY POLICY, WHICH CAN BE FOUND AT http://www.workchopapp.com/legal/#Privacy, AND WHICH ARE INCORPORATED 
							HEREIN BY REFERENCE. If you choose to not agree with any of these terms, you may not use the Service.
			<br><br><b>	2.  Workchop Service</b><br>
							These Terms of Service apply to all users of the Workchop Service. Information provided by our users through the Workchop Service 
							may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by Workchop. Workchop has no control over, and assumes 
							no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites. In addition, Workchop will not and 
							cannot censor or edit the content of any third-party site. By using the Service, you expressly acknowledge and agree that Workchop 
							shall not be responsible for any damages, claims or other liability arising from or related to your use of any third-party website.
			<br><br><b>	3.  Workchop Access</b><br>
							A. Subject to your compliance with these Terms of Service, Workchop hereby grants you permission to use the Service, provided that:
								(i) 	your use of the Service as permitted is solely for your personal use, and you are not permitted to resell or charge others 
										for use of or access to the Service, or in any other manner inconsistent with these Terms of Service; 
								(ii) 	you will not duplicate, transfer, give access to, copy or distribute any part of the Service in any medium without 
										Workchop's prior written authorization; 
								(iii) 	you will not attempt to reverse engineer, alter or modify any part of the Service; and 
								(iv) 	you will otherwise comply with the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.<br>
							B. 	In order to access and use the features of the Service, you acknowledge and agree that you will have to provide Workchop 
								with your mobile phone number and email address. You expressly acknowledge and agree that in order to provide the Service, 
								Workchop may periodically access your contact list and/or address book on your mobile device to find and keep track of mobile 
								phone numbers of other users of the Service. When providing your mobile phone number, you must provide accurate and complete 
								information. You hereby give your express consent to Workchop to access your contact list and/or address book for mobile phone 
								numbers in order to provide and use the Service. You are solely responsible for the messages that you submit and that are 
								displayed for your mobile phone number on the Workchop Service. You must notify Workchop immediately of any breach of security 
								or unauthorized use of your mobile phone. Although Workchop will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use 
								of your account, you may be liable for the losses of Workchop or others due to such unauthorized use.
							C. 	You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots," "spiders," "offline readers," etc. 
								or "load testers" such as wget, apache bench, mswebstress, httpload, blitz, Xcode Automator, Android Monkey, etc., that accesses the 
								Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the Workchop servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably 
								produce in the same period by using a Workchop application, and you are forbidden from ripping the content unless specifically 
								allowed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Workchop grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy 
								materials from the website for the sole purpose of creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or 
								archives of such materials. Workchop reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases. While we 
								don't disallow the use of sniffers such as Ethereal, tcpdump or HTTPWatch in general, we do disallow any efforts to reverse-engineer 
								our system, our protocols, or explore outside the boundaries of the normal requests made by Workchop clients. We have to disallow 
								using request modification tools such as fiddler or whisker, or the like or any other such tools activities that are meant to explore 
								or harm, penetrate or test the site. You must secure our permission before you measure, test, health check or otherwise monitor any network 
								equipment, servers or assets hosted on our domain. You agree not to collect or harvest any personally identifiable information, including 
								phone number and emails from the Service, nor to use the search and communication systems provided by the Service for any fraudulent 
								practices or spam purposes. You agree not to spam, or solicit for any purposes theusers of the Service other than the purposes for which 
								the product was created.
			<br><br><b>	4. 	Intellectual Property Rights</b><br>
							The design of the Workchop Service along with Workchop created text, scripts, graphics, interactive features and the like, except 
							Review Submissions (as defined below), and the trademarks, service marks and logos contained therein ("Marks"), are owned by or 
							licensed to Workchop, subject to copyright and other intellectual property rights under Nigeria and foreign laws and international 
							conventions. The Service is provided to you AS IS for your information and personal use only. Workchop reserves all rights not 
							expressly granted in and to the Service. You agree to not engage in the use, copying, or distribution of any of the Service other 
							than expressly permitted herein, including any use, copying, or distribution of Review Submissions of third parties obtained 
							through the Service for any commercial purposes.
			<br><br><b>	5.  User Review Submissions</b><br>
							A. 	The Workchop Service allows Workchop users to submit status text, profile photos, reviews on vendors, sector location selection
								and other communications submitted by you, (collectively, the "Review Submissions"). These Review Submissions may be hosted, 
								shared, and/or published as part of the Workchop Service, and may be visible to other users of the Service who may or may not 
								have your mobile phone number in their mobile phone.. For clarity, direct messages, location data and photos or files that you 
								send directly to other Workchop users will only be viewable by those Workchop user(s) or group(s) you directly send such 
								information; but Review Submissions may be globally viewed by Workchop users that may or may not have your mobile phone number 
								on their smartphone, unless the user is blocked by you. Currently, we have no method of providing different levels of 
								visibility of your Review Submissions among users that have your mobile phone number – you acknowledge and agree that any 
								Review Submissions may be globally viewed by users that may or may not have your mobile phone number, so don’t submit or 
								post status messages or profile photos that you don’t want to be seen globally. As clarified in the following section, you 
								retain your ownership rights in your Review Submissions. You understand that whether or not such Review Submissions are 
								published, Workchop does not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any submissions.
							B.  You shall be solely responsible for your own Review Submissions and the consequences of posting or publishing them. Because 
								Workchop is only acting as a repository of data, user submitted reviews do not necessarily represent the views or opinions of 
								Workchop, and Workchop makes no guarantees as to the validity, accuracy or legal status of any reviews. In connection with 
								Review Submissions, you affirm, represent, and/or warrant that: (i) you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, 
								and permissions to use and authorize Workchop to use all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights 
								in and to any and all Review Submissions to enable inclusion and use of the Review Submissions in the manner contemplated by 
								the Service and these Terms of Service; and (ii) you have the written consent, release, and/or permission of each and every 
								identifiable individual person in the Review  Submission to use the name or likeness of each and every such identifiable 
								individual person to enable inclusion and use of the Review Submissions in the manner contemplated by the Service and these 
								Terms of Service. To be clear: you retain all of your ownership rights in your Review Submissions, but you have to have the 
								rights in the first place. However, by submitting the Review Submissions to Workchop, you hereby grant Workchop a worldwide, 
								non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicenseable and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works 
								of, display, and perform the Review Submissions in connection with the Workchop Service and Workchop's (and its successor's) 
								business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Workchop Service (and derivative 
								works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels. You also hereby grant each subscriber to your status on 
								the Workchop Service a non-exclusive license to access your Review Submissions through the Service. The foregoing license 
								granted by you terminates once you remove or delete a Review Submission from the Workchop Service.
							C.  In connection with Review Submissions, you further agree that you will not: 
								(i) 	submit material that is copyrighted, protected by trade secret or otherwise subject to third party proprietary rights, 
										including privacy and publicity rights, unless you are he owner of such rights or have permission from their rightful owner 
										to post the material and to grant Workchop all of the license rights granted herein; 
								(ii) 	publish falsehoods or misrepresentations that could damage Workchop or any third party on the app; 
								(iii) 	submit material that is unlawful, obscene, defamatory, libelous, threatening, harassing, hateful, racially or ethnically 
										offensive, or encourages conduct that would be considered a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, violate 
										any law, or is otherwise inappropriate; 
								(iv) 	post advertisements or solicitations of business; 
								(v) 	impersonate another person; 
								(vi) 	send or store material containing software viruses, worms, Trojan horses or other harmful computer code, files, scripts, 
										agents or programs; (vii) interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Service or the data contained 
										therein; or 
								(viii) 	attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service or its related systems or networks.
							D.  Workchop does not endorse any Review Submission or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and Workchop expressly 
								disclaims any and all liability in connection with Review Submissions. Workchop does not permit copyright infringing activities and 
								infringement of intellectual property rights via its Service, and Workchop will remove all content and Review Submissions if properly 
								notified that such content or Review Submission infringes on another's intellectual property rights. To file a copyright infringement 
								notification, please send a written communication that includes substantially the following (see Section 512(c)(3) of the Digital 
								Millennium Copyright Act): 
								(i) 	A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is 
										allegedly infringed; 
								(ii) 	Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online 
										site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works; 
								(iii) 	Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be 
										removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate 
										the material, including the mobile phone number of the Workchop user allegedly infringing the copyrighted work; 
								(iv) 	Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact the complaining party, such as an address, 
										telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted; 
								(v) 	A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not 
										authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and 
								(vi) 	A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining 
										party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. Such takedown 
										notices may be emailed to support at workchop.com. Workchop reserves the right to remove content and Review Submissions 
										without prior notice. Workchop may also terminate a user's access to the Service, if they are determined to be a repeat 
										infringer, or for any or no reason, including being annoying. A repeat infringer is a User who has been notified of 
										infringing activity more than once and/or has had a Review Submission removed from the Service more than twice. 
										An annoying person is anyone who is (capriciously or not) determined to be annoying by authorized Workchop employees, 
										agents, subagents, superagents or superheros. Workchop also reserves the right to decide whether content or a Review 
										Submission is appropriate and complies with these Terms of Service for violations other than copyright infringement and 
										violations of intellectual property law, such as, but not limited to excessive length or limited interest. Workchop may 
										remove such Review Submissions and/or terminate a User's access for uploading such material in violation of these Terms of 
										Service at any time, without prior notice and at its sole discretion.
							E.  You understand that when using the Workchop Service you will be exposed to Review Submissions from a variety of sources, and that 
								Workchop is not responsible for the accuracy, usefulness, safety, or intellectual property rights of or relating to such Review 
								Submissions, and that such Review Submissions are not the responsibility of Workchop. You further understand and acknowledge that 
								you may be exposed to Review Submissions that are inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable, and you agree to waive, and 
								hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you have or may have against Workchop with respect thereto, and agree to 
								indemnify and hold Workchop, its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, and/or licensors, harmless to the fullest extent 
								allowed by law regarding all matters related to your use of the Workchop Service.
							F.  Workchop permits you to link to materials on the Service for personal purposes only. Workchop reserves the right to discontinue any 
								aspect of the Workchop Service at any time.

							be at risk or threatened. Workchop also reserves the right to disclose Personally Identifiable Information and/or 
							non-personally-identifiable information that Workchop believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of 
							Service, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, 
							to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of the Workchop Site or our servers, and to 
							protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Workchop, our users or others.
							
			<br><br><b>		Your Choices</b><br>
							You may, of course, decline to submit Personally Identifiable Information through the Workchop Site or the Workchop Service, in 
							which case Workchop may not be able to provide certain services to you. If you do not agree with our Privacy Policy or Terms of 
							Service, please delete your account, uninstall the Workchop mobile application and discontinue use of the Workchop Service; your 
							continued usage of the Workchop Service will signify your assent to and acceptance of our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. To 
							protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as SMS authentication in certain cases) to verify your identity 
							before registering your mobile phone number and granting you access to the Workchop Service. Please contact Workchop via email to 
							support at Workchop.com or available web forms with any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, your personal information, 
							your consent, or your opt-in or opt-out choices.
							
			<br><br><b>		Our Commitment To Data Security</b><br>
							Workchop uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your 
							personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Workchop and you do so 
							at your own risk. Using unsecured wifi or other unprotected networks to submit messages through the Workchop Service is never 
							recommended. Once we receive your transmission of information, Workchop makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the 
							security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, 
							altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. If Workchop learns of a security 
							systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Workchop may 
							post a notice on the Workchop Site or through the Workchop Service if a security breach occurs.
							
			<br><br><b>		Our Commitment To Childrens' Privacy</b><br>
							Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Workchop does not knowingly collect or maintain 
							Personally Identifiable Information or non-personally-identifiable information on the Workchop Site or Workchop Service from persons 
							under 16 years of age, and no part of the Workchop Service is directed to or intended to be used by persons under 16. If you are 
							under 16 years of age, then please do not use the Workchop Service or access the Workchop Site at any time or in any manner. If 
							Workchop learns that Personally Identifiable Information of persons under 16 years of age has been collected on the Workchop Site 
							or Workchop Service, then Workchop may deactivate the account and/or make the status submissions inaccessible. And always, think of 
							the children!
							
			<br><br><b>		In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy</b><br>
							In the event that Workchop is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right to transfer or assign the 
							information we have collected from our users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the 
							(hopefully) unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, 
							or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your 
							personal information is treated, transferred, or used.
							
			<br><br><b>		Changes and updates to this Privacy Notice</b><br>
							This Privacy Policy may be revised periodically and this will be reflected by the "effective date" below. Please revisit this page 
							to stay aware of any changes. Your continued use of the Workchop Site and Workchop Service constitutes your agreement to this 
							Privacy Policy and any amendments.
